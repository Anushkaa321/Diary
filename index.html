May 2023, when you entered my life, you know how happy I was on that day. It felt as if I had found everything.<br />
Talking about happiness, it was indeed a joyful moment. The boy whom I had only seen during class, I had a conversation with him.
 I had fallen in love with you back then,but didn't express it because I thought you'd think I only approached you for that reason.
 I swear there were real butterflies swirling in my stomach.
I found the best guy in the world,If God were to bring the best guy in the world in front of me, I would still choose only you because I love you so much with all my heart, with a passion.
 I want to make every day special for you, I want to love you, I want to make all your troubles my own. 

I know that people have let you down and your trust has been shaken, which is why you've become somewhat rude today.
 You're afraid that I might let you down in the future. But I am not like those people. I will never betray your trust, will never hurt you. 
 I wish for your happiness and  want to share my life and age with you. 

The mistake was entirely mine; I thought you were just like me, someone who enjoys jokes and humor, which is why I started teasing you. 
But I was wrong. I admit that I played a nasty prank, even involving your friends, but please trust me that it was all just a joke. 
Anushka is only yours, never belonged to anyone else before, and never will. Please don't vent your anger on me jaan. 
Forgive me once, let's forget everything and start fresh, with nothing but love. Let's leave the future to the future. If today is good, tomorrow will be too. 
 Trust me, I am yours and will remain so. To hell with everyone else; Jb tum class krke thak k aao to mai tumhe relax krsku tumhra dhiyan rakh sku ,please allow me.
 Let me love you,forgive me ,my dearüò≠
